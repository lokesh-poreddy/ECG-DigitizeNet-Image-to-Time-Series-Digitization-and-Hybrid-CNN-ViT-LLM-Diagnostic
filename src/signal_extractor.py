# signal_extractor.py
# This file contains the functions from Cell 2 used for:
# - Adaptive normalization
# - Grid removal
# - Skeletonization
# - Trace extraction
# - Pixel-to-voltage conversion
# - Resampling

# NOTE:
# Insert your complete Cell 2 signal extractor functions here manually
# because the full code is long.
